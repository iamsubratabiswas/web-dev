    <h1>insrtuctions to operate github</h1>
    <!--
        create github account,download git-scm and set terminal by 'git bash'  
        
        create a new repository on the command line
echo "# web-dev" >> README.md    //make a README.md = web-dev
git init   //open message evelop
git add README.md     //add message inside envelop use "." in case of multiple
git commit -m "first commit"  //close envelop
git branch -M main  
git remote add origin https://github.com/iamsubratabiswas/web-dev.git   //set origin/destination to send

git config --global user.email "subrotobiswas53@gmail.com" //for setting purpose
git config --global user.name "iamsubratabiswas" //for setting purpose

git push -u origin main  //send message to origin 
â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/iamsubratabiswas/web-dev.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main  //for first time to recognise branch

git diff   //to veiw chages  after using this comand we need to use "q" to exit

//changed code
git add . //' "." to use all code inside web-dev
git commit -m "commit name"
git push // no -u origin need to mention as already existing details

//if someone changed code at time of teamwork you need to take that code to your local machine
git pull

you can add summery and check uncheck repo element from desktop easily
we can commit,push,fetch codes easily by github desktop 
    if someone chnges our codes then we can fetch and pull it by 
single clicks and automatically codes go to local machiines

so it is bidirectional/two way solution



//by command 
to check branch:
git branch
git checkout -a  //all branch
git checkout  //current branch
new branch: git checkout -b branchname  (eg:camera)
to take upstream:git push --set-upstream origin camera
git checkout develop   //change to branch 'develop'
to restore changes: git restore filename

//to check username,emails
git config user.name
git config user.email
we can create new branch,check history etc visually 

to publish special branch name is
 gh-pages

then go to settings , somewhere you can get your page is live ,just copy the link without last dot "." and share

if you delete the branch ,and in your local machine you are still in deleted brach but modify some of codes already,then you cant chage branch directly
then how to  change branch ?
check what are modified ? revert it , now you can change branch, pull it ,afer that modify the code

to publish ,again take all codes to gh-pages by pull request ,merge it 
if after merge it not showing immediately ,then inspect=>console=>mouse long press on reload button=>empty cache hard reload

//deployed file name : by default= index.html > in lowercse 
if another name : eg : site.html
then append site.html on link and share it 
folder,file format everything must be in original case existing
